== Hello World: Webservice

This little example generally uses the PLC4X subscription API and for every subscription event, it sends a JSON formatted request to a remote webservice.

While generally the example should work with any sort of driver, the handling of incoming events is highly tied to the KNX driver using a `knxproj` file to decode the incoming messages.

So if you would like to use it with any other sort of driver, you will probably need to update the HelloWebservice.ValueChangeHandler.accept method and adjust that to your usecase.
