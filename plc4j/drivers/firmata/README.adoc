== Firmata Driver

Built to work with the Arduino Sketch available from https://github.com/firmata/arduino/blob/master/examples/StandardFirmata/StandardFirmata.ino[here].

Functionality:

- The driver supports Writing and Subscribing to data.
- As soon as the driver connects, it resets the StandardFirmata sketch
- As soon as a subscription comes in, the driver checks, if the input is currently not configured, set to output or set to input
-- If it's not configured, it is set to input mode
-- If it's set to output, an error is returned
-- If it's set to input, nothing is changed
- After a subscription comes in or is cancelled the driver checks if any changes are needed and these updates are executed.
- As soon as an update comes in, the driver checks which subscriptions need to receive an update and fires events accordingly.
