== Camel-PLC4X Component
The Camel Component for PLC4X allows you to create routes using the PLC4X API to read from a PLC device or write to it.

=== Maven dependency
To use the Camel component, just add following dependency to your project
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.plc4x</groupId>
  <artifactId>plc4j-apache-camel</artifactId>
  <version>{current-last-released-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

== Endpoint
[cols="2"]
|===
|Name |Value

|*Tags*   | The tags to read as `Map<String,String>` containing the tagname associated to its query
|*Trigger*|(*Consumer*) Query to a trigger. On a rising edge of the trigger, the tags will be read once
|*Period* |(*Consumer*) Interval on which the Trigger should be checked
|*Driver parameters* | Every Parameter unknown to the Component will be passed to the driver
|===
=== URI Format
----
plc4x:[driver-code]://[IP|host][?parameters]
----
Note that sometimes you want to add the `Transport` code after the `Driver` code:

----
plc4x:[driver-code]:[transport-code]://[IP|host][?parameters]
----
== Consumer
The consumer supports one-time reading or Triggered Reading. (_Schedulded Reading using Period only soon_).To read from
the PLC, use a  `Map<String,String>` containing the Alias and Queries for the Data you want.

The Body create by the Consumer will be a `Map<String,Object>` containing the Aliases and there associated value
read from the PLC.

== Producer
To write data to the PLC, we also use a `Map`. The difference with the Producer is that the `Value` of the Map has also to
be a Map. Also, this `Map` has to be set into the `Body` of the `Message`

The used `Map` would be a `Map<String,Map<String,Object>` where the `Map<String,Object>` represent the Query and the
data we want to write to it.
