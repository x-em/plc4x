== Individual Resource Address Format

=== Connection String

UMAS has the following connection string format:-
----
umas:{transport}://{ip-address}:{port}?{options}
----
An example connection string would look like:-
----
umas:tcp://127.0.0.1:502
----
Note the transport, port and option fields are optional.


=== General Format

In general all UMAS addresses have this format:

----
{tag-name}.{child-name}.{child-name}:{data-type}[{array-size}]
----

Depending on the type of tag the child-name parameters are optional.
e.g. A tag with a BOOL data type could be 'TESTING_BOOL_1' whereas
if it is a UDT the tag name is followed by the child 'TESTING_UDT_1.START' which in itself could be a BOOL.

If the array-size part is omitted, the size-default of `1` is assumed.

If the data-type part is omitted, it defaults to the data type of the tag read from the PLC.

=== Memory Areas

Apart from tags defined in the PLC the driver is also able to access the %S and %SW
system memory areas.

The specific address details of the data in these areas are outlined in the devices
manual.

An example of the address format of these areas is %SW1 or %S20.

=== Data Types

The following data types are supported

- BOOL (boolean)
- SINT (int 8)
- USINT (uint 8)
- BYTE (uint 8)
- INT (int 16)
- UINT (uint 16)
- WORD (uint 16)
- DINT (int 32)
- UDINT (uint 32)
- DWORD (uint 32)
- REAL (float)
- STRING (char)
- TIME
- DATE
- TOD (Time of Day)
- DATE_AND_TIME
