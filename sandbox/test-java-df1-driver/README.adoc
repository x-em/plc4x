== Using the Driver in the hello-world example

Add the driver to the pom.xml

        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.apache.plc4x.sandbox</groupId>
          <artifactId>test-java-df1-driver</artifactId>
          <version>0.6.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
          <scope>runtime</scope>
        </dependency>

Then start the Hello world (Ideally in IntelliJ) with the following program arguments:

    df1:serial///{com-port-name} {address}

Currently the parsing of addresses is not implemented yet, so it will not work.

But as soon as that's done, this should work.
