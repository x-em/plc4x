|===

== Connection String

The OPC UA drivers uses the connection string

----

opcua:{transport}://{ip-address}:{port}?{options}

----

An example of this connection string would be:-

----

opcua:tcp://127.0.0.1:12686?discovery=true&username=admin&password=password

----

Note the transport, port and options fields are optional.

== Secure communication
The secure channel implementation within Apache PLC4X project have been tested against existing open source server implementations.
This includes Eclipse Milo (all modes) as well as OPC Foundation .NET server (except `Basic128Rsa15`).
Manual tests proven that driver is able to communicate with OPC UA server launched on PLCs as well as commercial simulators.

Depending on actual configuration of remote end there might be necessity to prepare client certificate.
Preparation of certificate is beyond driver, however in case when no client certificate is provided, it will be auto-generated to establish a session.
Please follow our tutorial link:../getting-started/opcua-client-certificate.html[on provisioning of client private key and certificate].
By following it you will be able to create self-signed certificate for use with both hardware and software based OPC-UA servers.
Please note that there are multiple appearances of certificates within specification.
There is transport level certificate which can be provided though keystore options, but there is also a X509 Certificate which can be used for authentication (currently unsupported by PLC4X).

The security modes differ between themselves by strength of applied signature and encryption algorithms.
Driver is able to communicate with single security mode at the time.
Additionally, to security policy it is possible to specify `message-security` option which indicates expected security settings after initial handshake.
By default, this option is set to `SIGN_ENCRYPT` which imposes high security settings and full encryption of exchanged message payloads.
In case when additional diagnostics is needed payloads has to be traced through TRACE level log entries.
The `SIGN` mode gives possibility o browse packets in tools such wireshark.

=== Certificate verification
The OPC UA specification defines its own procedures for certificate validation.
In order to simplify implementation by default server certificate validation is relaxed.
Unless explicitly disabled through configuration of `trust-store-file` all server certificates will be accepted without validation.

In case when secure communication is enabled the `trust-store-file` option might be used to point certificates which client should accept.
The acceptance rely on regular TLS checks (expiry date, certificate path etc.), does not validate OPC UA specific parts such as application URI.

=== Negotiation procedure
Depending on settings driver might or might not attempt to discover endpoints from remote server.
In case when `discovery` option is set to `true` driver will look up server certificate through connection attempt.
The discovery option also enables checks of server endpoints for matching security settings.

Once initial discovery is completed and driver finds endpoint matching its security settings it will launch second connection attempt which will switch to configured security mode.

Each connection attempt made by driver attempt to use limits described in table above.
Role of these options is declaration of values accepted and expected by client.
Once server returns its limits (`Acknowledge` for supplied `Hello` call) driver picks values from these.
The only one note is that driver takes minimum of local receive and remote send buffer size.
It does same with local send and remote receive buffer.

Usual values of `encoding.send-buffer-size` and `encoding.receive-buffer-size` PLC devices remain at 8196 bytes.

NOTE: Due to lack of complete implementation of negotiation and chunking logic the OPC UA driver prior Apache PLC4X 0.11 release could supply calls exceeding server limits.

== Address Format
To read, write and subscribe to data, the OPC UA driver uses the variable declaration string of the OPC UA server it is
connecting to.
It includes the namespace(`ns`) of the hierarchy tree followed by the type of identifier string(`s`), numeric(`i`),
binary(`b`) or guid(`g`) and its address. The Data Type is an optional field, if it is not included a default data type
is selected based on the datatype of the returned value. For Unsigned data types it needs to be included otherwise.

----

ns={namespace-index};[s|i|g|b]={Identifier};a=attributeId;{Data Type}

----

The `a` parameter which stands for `attributeId` of an object is optional, and by default it is assumed to be Value 13 (`0x0d`).
Value of this parameter can be specified using numeric value or OPC-UA attribute name (case-sensitive).

=== Data Types

The following data types are supported

- BOOL (boolean)
- SINT (int 8)
- USINT (uint 8)
- BYTE (uint 8)
- INT (int 16)
- UINT (uint 16)
- WORD (uint 16)
- DINT (int 32)
- UDINT (uint 32)
- DWORD (uint 32)
- LINT (int 64)
- ULINT (uint 64)
- LWORD (uint 64)
- REAL (float)
- LREAL (double)
- CHAR (char)
- WCHAR (2 byte char)
- STRING (utf-8)
- WSTRING (utf-16)


=== Example of a valid OPC UA address:

The following are examples of valid addresses

String address:
----
ns=2;s=HelloWorld/ScalarTypes/Boolean
ns=2;s=HelloWorld/ScalarTypes/Boolean;BOOL
ns=2;s=HelloWorld/ScalarTypes/Boolean;a=Value;BOOL
----
Numeric address
----
ns=1;i=1337
ns=1;i=1337;DINT
ns=1;i=1337;a=Value;DINT
----
GUID address:
----
ns=2;g=09087e75-8e5e-499b-954f-f2a8624db28a
ns=2;g=09087e75-8e5e-499b-954f-f2a8624db28a;REAL
ns=2;g=09087e75-8e5e-499b-954f-f2a8624db28a;a=Value;REAL
----
Event Subscription:
----
ns=0;i=2253;a=EventNotifier;BOOL{EventId: '', EventType: '', Severity: '', Time: '', Message: ''}
----

Note the Identifiers `s`,`i`,`b` and `g` specify the format of the address not the data type of the returned value.
The `a` attribute is required only for event subscriptions which additionally makes use of tag config.
Tag config is a list of key-value pairs which rely on simplified JSON syntax.

== Some useful tips

The namespace (e.g. `ns=2`) within the address is specific to the server you are connecting to.
Objects appearing in namespaces can, and will vary, as namespaces are used to separate scope of objects.

OPC-UA servers support subscriptions which allow to reduce amount of data exchanged between client and server.
There are three primary subscription modes: Data Change Notification, Status Change Notification and Event Notification.
Currently, Apache PLC4X client supports Data Change Notification and Event Notification.

Under the hood subscriptions still require client to request data though PublishRequest.

=== OPC UA Data Change Notification

Data change notifications are created with list of tags, after which client need to send publish requests.
Upon each publish request server will send response which will include values of all tag for which subscription was created.
While OPC-UA specification permits mutation of subscription contents, PLC4X API does not allow that.

By default, `Cyclic` and `Change of State` subscriptions operations defined in PLC4X client API result in data change notifications.

=== OPC UA Event Notification

Third mode of subscription defined by PLC4X API is `Event Subscription`.
This kind of subscription is available since PLC4X 0.13 and have slightly different syntax, which brings more complex data.
OPC-UA events can be used to receive notifications of various kinds which appear when specific situation happens.
In other protocols this kind of behavior can function as alarms or alerts.

In order to create OPC-UA event subscription you need to:

- define `a=EventNotifier` or `a=12`
- specify event fields to retrieve through a tag config

The tag config key must match OPC-UA event field.
The tag config value is not used, thus it can not be used to specify filter criteria for field value.
Fields which are supported are defined in OPC UA `BaseEventType`:

- `EventId`
- `EventType`
- `SourceNode`
- `SourceName`
- `Time`
- `ReceiveTime`
- `LocalTime`
- `Message`
- `Severity`

Example syntax: `ns=0;i=2253;a=EventNotifier;BOOL{EventId: '', EventType: '', Severity: '', Time: '', Message: ''}`.

Subscription event generated by client upon receiving notification will contain an object (`PlcSTRUCT`/`Map`) which will contain all requested fields.
Please note that Apache PLC4X does only basic normalization of data, thus your application need to take care of actual processing of event data.

== Tag metadata

This driver supports tag metadata.
Beyond standard metadata fields such `timestamp` and `timestamp_source` it can provide following keys:

- `opcua_quality`
- `opcua_server_timestamp`
- `opcua_source_timestamp`

Appearance of these fields is conditional, they are provided only when it can be sourced from packets exchanged between client and server.
This means that depending on operation conducted by client (read/write/subscribe) metadata will vary.

== Compatibility with OPC-UA Servers

There are multiple OPC-UA server implementations.
Each of it have its own specifics, sometimes showing up more detailed security handling or further edge case buried in specification.
So far Apache PLC4X OPC-UA client have been confirmed to be working with below servers (order in chronology of passed tests/confirmed compatibility):

== More details on OPC UA

https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/[OPC UA]
The OPC Unified Architecture (UA), released in 2008, is a platform independent service-oriented architecture that integrates all the functionality of the individual OPC Classic specifications into one extensible framework.

This multi-layered approach accomplishes the original design specification goals of:

* Functional equivalence: all COM OPC Classic specifications are mapped to UA
* Platform independence: from an embedded micro-controller to cloud-based infrastructure
* Secure: encryption, authentication, and auditing
* Extensible: ability to add new features without affecting existing applications
* Comprehensive information modeling: for defining complex information
